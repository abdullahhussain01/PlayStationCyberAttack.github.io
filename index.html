            <h1>The Playstaion Cyber Attack Blog</h1>
            <p>In April 2011, the PlayStation Network (PSN) suffered a massive cyber attack that resulted in the
                compromise of personal and financial data for millions of users. The attackers were able to gain access
                to users' names, addresses, email addresses, birthdates, and login information, as well as their credit
                card information, in some cases.
                Sony, the parent company of the PSN, first became aware of the attack on April 19, 2011, and shut down
                the network that same day. The company later confirmed that the attackers had gained access to the
                network via a vulnerability in the company's software.
                It wasn't until May 14, 2011, that Sony informed its users of the data breach. The company urged users
                to be vigilant and to monitor their credit card statements for any suspicious activity.</p>
            <p class="font1">The impact of the PlayStation cyber attack was significant. Approximately 77 million user
                accounts were compromised, making it one of the largest data breaches in history at the time. The attack
                also resulted in a loss of trust for Sony and the PSN, as users felt that their personal and financial
                data had been mishandled.
                In addition, the attack had financial consequences for Sony, with the company estimating that it cost
                around $171 million to deal with the breach. OurMine, a Saudi Arabia based hacking group hacked the
                official social media platforms including Twitter and Facebook accounts of Sony‘s PlayStation Network
                (PSN) on Sunday.

                After taking over the PSN’s Twitter account with 14.6 million followers, the group started sending
                Tweets encouraging the Network to contact the group through its website to buy its IT security service
                to protect them from future hack attacks.

                The group also claimed to have access to PSN‘s database with no plans to leak it online since the group
                considers itself “a security group. “No, we aren’t going to share it, we are a security group if you
                work at PlayStation then please go to our website,” the Tweet said.</p>
